Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php





What I expect:

A. A readme with:

1.  Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting. Logic..

Answer is:: This codes is very dirty, There is no validations for the security, no parse for the response, not gates for the permissions, even not handling the error exceptions as well.

2.  Refactor it if you feel it needs formatting. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses.

Answer is:: I only refactor the BookingController.php codes & I remove some of the codes of them as I've short time & you can easily understand, how i did. I am not done with
the Booking repository due to shortage of time but it seems me this codes is written by an intern.

Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes.
